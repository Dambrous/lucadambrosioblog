## Who I am

Hello, I introduce myself, my name is Luca D'Ambrosio, I am twenty years old and I was born in Pescara (Pe) in Abruzzo (Italy) on 07/25/2001. I obtained the high school diploma at the "Galileo Galilei Scientific High School". I also played 2 "Computer Science" championships, arriving 2nd in one of the foreseen ones. I have always been in the passion of IT, so I have found programming my future, my greatest passion. Immediately after graduating, I chose the University of L'Aquila in the studies of "Information Engineering specialized in" DATABASE ", after about a year I found a job at a company in ROME called" Rapsodoo "where I currently work as “Developer BACKEND.” My programming and tool experiences are: Python, Javascript, Html, Css, Github, docker, Java. Other languages ​​such as TypeScript, Angular I am studying them in my spare time to deepen my knowledge at 360 ° even "front-end". Not being able to follow the frontal training in the university, I decided to change by opting for the "telematic" one ("ECampus University") continuing my studies in Computer Engineering "DATABASE".
